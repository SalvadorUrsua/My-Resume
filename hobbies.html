            <h2><li>Wood Working Activities:</h2>
                <p>Just recently I created 3 tables. The first table I created was intended for my makeshift shop for my wood working activities.</p>
                <p>The second table I created was meant for our living room. It is long enough so that we can put snacks on it while having friendly conversation with our guests or visitors.</p>
                <p>The third table I created was a computer table. On it I have my two monitors placed on top and my printer just underneath together with the my computer and its AVR.</p>
                <p>The next thing I created was a big tool box for my wood working tools and also serves as long chair where I sit or sometimes take a nap in the afternoon.</p>
